# WeCloud
In this project I created a data cloud server which one can backup data online from different users and locations.<br/>
The server is cross platformed, which means it can work on Windows or Linux.<br/>
How to make it work?<br/>
• Download Zip files.<br/>
• Install Watchdog:<br/>
  • pip install watchdog<br/>
• Run server<br/>
• Connect to server from any PC.<br/>
