# WeCloud
In this project I created a data cloud server which one can backup data online from different users and locations.<br/>
The server is cross platformed, which means it can work on Windows or Linux.<br/>
How to make it work?<br/>
<br/>
• Download Zip files.
```
• Install Watchdog:
  • pip install watchdog
  ```
• Run server
• Connect to server from any PC.
