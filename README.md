# WeCloud
In this project I created a data cloud server which one can backup data online from different users and locations.
The server is cross platformed, which means it can work on Windows or Linux.
How to make it work?
• Download Zip files.
• Install Watchdog:
  • pip install watchdog
• Run server
• Connect to server from any PC.
